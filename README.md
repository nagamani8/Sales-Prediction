# Sales-Prediction
This is a project to build a model which predicts sales based on money spent on different platforms for marketing.
Import advertising dataset which consists of money spent on different platforms for advertising and sales which are dependent on the amount spent.
Analyse the relationship between sales and advertising cost using regression model.
Here Linear Regression is used to analyse as sales is a numeric value which has to be predicted.
(Sales is a predictor variable).
RMSE(Root Mean square error) is used to  measure the differences between values (sample values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed.
R-squared is used to measure the goodness of fit of  regression model used. At last,fit is visualized on the test set.
